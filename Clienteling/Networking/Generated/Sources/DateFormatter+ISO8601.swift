        // with the given locale. So in 12-hour settings (i.e. the user's phone
        // set to 12hr time instead of 24hr time) the `HH` portion of the format
        // was overridden to return no leading 0. This failed validation.
        // In any case, it probably makes sense for this to be in a specific locale
        // and not changing based on the user's locale since this is not something
        // that will be displayed to the user.
